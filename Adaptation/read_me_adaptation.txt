This folder includes all the codes of mapping multisource data and recognizing adaptive behaviors. To calculate the temperature adaptation curve of households, please follow the file sequence outlined below:

1. smoothTemEleCurve.py
	This python file excutes the Savitzky-Golay filter to smooth the electricity consumption-temperature curve to avoid interference caused by the fluctuations. The input data includes in file  "electricity_consumption.csv" which can be find in the provided data folder. After running the code, the result will be saved as a file "2014-2018daily_smooth_w9.csv"

2. getKneePoint.py
	This python file excutes the Kneele method to capture the tipping points of the household's smoothed curve one by one. The input data is "2014-2018daily_smood_w9. csv" which can be generated by smoothTemEleCurve.py. After running the code, the result will be saved as a file "2014-2018daily_knee.csv"

3. getAdaptationCurve.py
	This python file can be used for calculating the temperature-related adaptation curve and the corresponding confidence intervals by Monte Carlo.  The input data is "2014-2018daily_knee.csv" which can be generated by getKneePoint.py. After running the code, the adaptation curve will be saved as files "inc_knee_total.csv" and "dec_knee_total.csv", and the confidence intervals will be saved as files "inc_knee_mcv2.csv" and "dec_knee_mcv2.csv"
